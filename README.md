# ChatWoot
Chatwoot is an open-source, omnichannel customer support platform designed to be a transparent and self-hostable alternative to tools like Intercom or Zendesk.  It helps a company by acting as a "Central Command Center" for every single customer interaction, regardless of where the conversation starts.
